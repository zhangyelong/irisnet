## IRIS OVERVIEW ################################################################

> The IRIS network is named after the Greek goddess Iris, said to be the  personification of the rainbow and the faithful messenger between heaven and humanity.

Contractual relationships are a fundamental building block of human society and the
importance of blockchain technology lies in providing a very efficient
and cost effective way of realizing reliable contractual
relationships: for the first time, trust (which is also very
costly to establish) is not needed when multiple parties participate in sophisticated
business interactions. It has been said that blockchain technology provides
the most important elements for distributed business to take place: lifting network effect
and very low transaction cost. More and more people see the potential of
blockchains as the new internet of value and will gradually transform the
current business models into more efficient distributed ones. Especially
the token mechanism embedded in most modern blockchain emphasizes each network
participant's right and will disrupt business in its current form [\[1\]][1].

However, blockchain technology is still in its early stages. As with any new technology, there are drawbacks. These include limited performance and undeveloped governance mechanisms. Presently, these drawbacks make it difficult for blockchains to support real-world distributed business collaboration. Consortium chains, such as Hyperledger Fabric and R3 Corda, and organisations such as the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, have tried to address those performance and governance issues to make blockchain technology more suitable for enterprises. However, today consortium chains are dominated by huge
enterprise companies. Furthermore their close-form off on-chain governance model
is very inefficient. Without a token economics model and the
openness and the excitement in public chains, consortium chains may be viewed as lacking vitality.

We would like to enhance the current blockchain technology and
make it possible to enable thousands and millions of Small Medium Businesses ("SMBs") and even individual freelance business service providers to provide their services and enjoy the rewards in an open network. To achieve this, we have identified the following challenges and consequent opportunities for technology innovations:

**Not all computation could or should be implemented as on-chain computations such as smart contracts**

The [Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) virtual
machine provided by Ethereum [\[2\]][2] runs Smart Contracts gives people a lot of hope of developing
decentralized applications. However Smart contracts can only handle deterministic logic (so
every node can reach an identical state after processing every
transaction and block) while huge amount of existing business logic that
is not deterministic and might vary at different time and under
different environmental parameters. Especially these days, business systems have placed an increasing amount of reliance on computer algorithms, including Natural Language Processing ("NLP"), machine learning, and operation research algorithms, for decision optimization. In those
algorithms, very often we purposely add some randomness to make the
decision not to get stuck at local optimal states while trying to find a
better sub-optimal result.

On the other hand, some of the real world business logics are meant to
be run once off-chain and shouldn't be implemented as smart contracts
this type of replicated computing. Integration and collaboration of off-chain services and resources with
a distributed ledger is key to further advance the adoption of
blockchain technology for more real-world use scenarios.

**How to reuse the existing blockchain resources, including both public chains and consortium chains**

It is infeasible to use one public chain to address all use cases.
Every day there are different chains going live which focus on one aspect
of problem solving such as distributed storage, asset ownership or predict market etc.
According to the coinmarketcap.com, there are more than 1000
cryptocurrencies currently active on various exchanges.

While building business applications involve handling storage and also
different source of data feeds. Another motivation of our work involves
how to support building distributed business applications by reusing
some of the existing work like storage (IPFS, SIA, Storj.io etc.), data feed
(Augur, Gnosis, Oraclize etc.) and IoT (IOTA etc.) provided by those
dedicated blockchains and not reinventing the wheel.

Besides, there are many (near) real-time business transactions do need
more close form consortium/permission/private chains to address
performance, security and business governance requirements. Our vision of distributed business infrastructure needs to have the Interoperability of many heterogeneous chains including public/consortium/permission/private chains.

Inter-chain technology is a very nature answer to the requirement.
However, till today, the existing Inter-chain technologies are mainly
designed to provide interoperability among existing blockchains and
focus on token value transfer. The question of how to consume the
resource provided in different chains still remains unanswered.

Comparing the proposed inter-chain technologies like Cosmos [\[3\]][3] and
Polkadot [\[4\]][4], we find out that Cosmos provides more mature base for
interoperability and scalability. Especially, we found the design of
"`many hubs and many zones`" and "`each zones are independent blockchains
having independent governance models`" from Cosmos provides a very
suitable architecture for modeling the real world complexity in a SOC
way. To best reuse the existing framework, we present the IRIS Network, a
decentralized inter-chain network composing hub and zones with
implementing a layer of service infrastructure based on
Cosmos/Tendermint [\[5\]][5], with enhanced usage of token .

Since the IRIS network is designed on top of Cosmos/Tendermint, we will first discuss Cosmos/Tendermint, summarize the features we inherit from Cosmos/Tendermint and summarize the innovations we have created.

### Cosmos and Tendermint ################################################################

Cosmos [\[3\]][3] intends to build the 'internet of blockchains'. It is a network of many independent blockchains, called "zones". Each zone is powered by classical Byzantine fault-tolerant ("BFT")
consensus protocols like [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/).

Tendermint provides a high-performance, consistent, secure BFT consensus
engine, where strict fork-accountability guarantees hold over the
behavior of malicious actors. Tendermint is well suited for scaling
heterogeneous blockchains including public blockchains such as Ethermint
[\[6\]][6], which is a blazing fast Proof-of-Stake implementation of
Ethereum, as well as performance critical permission/consortium chains.
The successful stories on using Tendermint in the permission/consortium
chain domain including Oracle [\[7\]][7], CITA [\[8\]][8] and
Hyperledger Burrow [\[9\]][9].

Tendermint is used as the consensus protocol for building the first zone
on the Cosmos Hub. Hub can connect to many different
kinds of zones, and the communication is achieved via an
inter-blockchain communication ("IBC") protocol, a kind of virtual UDP or
TCP for blockchains. Tokens can be transferred from one zone to another
securely through the Cosmos Hub, without the need for an exchange
or a trusted third party between zones.

To develop robust interoperable blockchains and blockchain applications
with Cosmos Hub, Cosmos SDK provides blockchain development
\'starter-kit\' of common blockchain modules while not enforcing
user stories thus giving maximum flexibility for application customization.

### IRIS Innovations ################################################################

IRIS network aims to build technology foundation which facilitate
construction of distributed business applications. It goes beyond today's
blockchain systems which are mainly for digitalized assets.

The key challenges that we aim to address via the IRIS network are two-fold:
* Integration and collaboration of off-chain computing and resources on
  a distributed ledger;
* interoperability of the services across
  heterogeneous chains.

We address those challenges through incorporation
of a service oriented infrastructure into Cosmos/Tendermint.

Our design inherits the thinking pattern from
many years of service-oriented architecture ("SOA") practices. SOA is an architectural approach to create
systems built from autonomous services which have explicit boundaries,
share schemas and contracts [\[13\]][13]. Earlier practice of SOA focused
on the implementation of Enterprise Service Bus ("ESB") which enables
communication among services via a common communication bus which
consists of a variety of point-to-point connections between providers
and consumers. However, centralized management of services through ESB could
trigger a single point of failure, also adds dependency of service
deployment. The recent surge of micro-services architectural style can be
seen as a development of SOA without focusing on the ESB rather using
light message queues for inter service communication. In IRIS network,
the inter service communication is intended to be implemented over blockchain to
leverage blockchain as a trusted machine for mediating business
collaborations. It runs without prerequisite of existing trust among service
provider and service consumer which is very hard to establish.

The IRIS network uses Tendermint protocol as a high-performance consensus
engine. Leveraging the flexibility provided by tendermint's Application
BlockChain Interface ("ABCI"), we define a set of service infrastructure
transaction types including service provisioning, service consumption
and service governance. As explained earlier, most business logic is not
suitable for implementation as deterministic smart contracts on
blockchain, we are using this service layer to move the business
application specific logics and transaction processing off the
blockchain itself and use the blockchain only to get consensus on the
results generated through those services. This idea is also inspired by
existing work from blockchain community when address performance issues
of moving some complicated computation off the main chain, such as Lightning
Network's off-chain state channels [\[10\]][10] as well as Plasma's fraud
proof side chains [\[11\]][11]. Although we are not implementing side chains,
we rip traditional business logic computation off the blockchain
 and use it as a trustworthy mediation bus for
complicated business collaboration.

For interchain communication, Cosmos IBC [\[12\]][12] defines a protocol for
transferring values from an account on one chain to an account on another
chain.  The IRIS network designs new semantics to allow cross-chain computation to be invoked by leveraging IBC.  We believe this capability is very important when building scalable business applications. Further details of potential use cases are set out below.

The IRIS network is intended to provide the service infrastructure for handing and coordinating on-chain transaction processing with off-chain data processing and business logic execution. Enhanced IBC capability
allows those off-chain processing to be invoked cross chain, if required. The IRIS network, as presently envisaged, will also include client-side tools, including a smart wallet enabling cross-chain multi-asset storage, as well as consume and provide iServices. We plan to provide SDKs for easy construction of iServices. For example, for a specific service definition, the Client SDK would generate the provider side skeleton as well as consumer side stub for major programming languages.

<div STYLE="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## IRIS Network Design ################################################################

![Figure of IRIS Network](https://github.com/irisnet/irisnet/blob/master/images/chap2-1.png?raw=true)

As illustrated in the figure above, the IRIS network is intended to have the
same topology as the Cosmos network.  We plan to connect the IRIS Hub to
the Cosmos Hub as one of its zones and regional hubs.  IRIS full nodes,
developed with the IRIS SDK (which is itself a planned extension of the
Cosmos SDK), are proposed to provide a service infrastructure as well as
offer integration with an embedded InterPlanetary File System ("IPFS") node.

IRIS Services (a.k.a. "iServices") intend to bridge the gap between the blockchain
world and the conventional business application world, by mediating a
complete lifecycle of off-chain services -- from their definition,
binding (provider registration), invocation, to their governance
(profiling and dispute resolution). By enhancing the IBC processing
logic to support service semantics, the IRIS SDK is intended to allow
distributed business services to be available across the internet of blockchains.

While the IRIS network focuses on providing an innovative solution
for distributed business applications, it is still part of
the broader Cosmos network.  All zones connected to our proposed IRIS hub would be able to interact with any other zone in the Cosmos network over
the standard IBC protocol.  Furthermore, by introducing a layer of service
semantics, which we believe could enable a whole new set of business scenarios,
the planned IRIS network would represent an increase in scale and diversity
of the Cosmos network.

### Network Actors

1. **Consumers** are those users who may consume off-chain services by sending
  requests to the network and receiving responses from the network.

2. **Providers** are those users who may offer the implementation of one or more
iService definitions and often act as *adaptors* of off-chain services and resources located
  in other public and consortium chains, as well as in enterprise legacy
  systems.  Providers monitor and process incoming requests and send responses
  back to the network.  A provider could at the same time act as a consumer
  by sending requests to other providers.  As planned, providers would be required to
  charge a fee for any services they might offer, and the service fee, by default, would be
  priced in the IRIS network's native fee token known as "IRIS"; providers
  could also price their services in other whitelisted Cosmos fee tokens, to be
  considered in due course.

3. **Profiler** is the special user who works on behalf of the IRIS Foundation
Limited ("Foundation"), a Hong Kong incorporated company limited by guarantee.
The Foundation will take the lead in building the IRIS network.  The profiler
is the sole user authorized to invoke iServices in the profiling mode, which
is intended to help create and maintain objective *provider profiles* that
consumers use to select suitable providers.

### IRIS Services

In this section, we set out the intended technical parameters for deploying iServices on the IRIS network.

**Service Definition**

A `Method` is composed of:

* `ID (int)`: The unique ID of this method in the encompassing iService

* `Name (string)`: The unique name of this method in the iService

* `Description (string)`: A description of this method

* `Input (string)`: A structured definition of the input parameters

* `Output (string)`: A structured definition of the output result

* `Error (string)`: A structured definition of all possible error conditions

* `OutputPrivacy (enum)`: Can be one of `NoPrivacy` or `PubKeyEncryption`

A `ServiceDefinition` is composed of:

* `Name (string)`: The name of this iService

* `Description (string)`: A description of this iService

* `Tags (string)`: Comma separated keywords about this iService

* `Creator (string)`: A self-description of the iService creator. *Optional*

* `ChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain where this iService was
  originally defined

* `Messaging (enum)`: Can be one of `Unicast` or `Multicast`

* `Methods ([]Method)`: The definition of methods available in this iService

A `CreateServiceDefinitionTx` transaction is composed of:

* `Definition (ServiceDefinition)`: The service definition to be created

**Service Binding**:

A `CreateServiceBindingTx` transaction is composed of:

* `DefinitionHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the service definition that the provider is binding to

* `ChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain where the provider is connected

* `ProviderAddress ([]byte)`: The provider's blockchain address

* `BindingType (enum)`: Can be one of `Local` or `Global`; choose `Global` if a
  provider wants the binding to be exposed to the rest of the world;
  otherwise, use `Local`

* `ProviderDeposit (int64)`: To create an effective binding, the provider
  must put down a deposit (in terms of IRIS token amount) that is greater than
  the value of the system parameter `MinProviderDeposit`; a larger deposit
  may imply more trustworthiness of the provider

* `ServicePricing (string)`: A structured definition of the service pricing
  model on a per method basis, including cost per call, volume discount,
  promotional terms etc.; service fee is by default listed in IRIS token but
  could also be quoted in other whitelisted fee tokens.

* `ServiceLevel (string)`: A structured definition of service level the
  provider agrees to bind himself to, in terms of response time,
  availability etc.

* `BindingExpiration (int64)`: The blockchain height where this binding
  expires; a negative number means "never expire"

An `UpdateServiceBindingTx` transaction is composed of:

* `DefinitionHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the service definition the
  provider has bound to

* `ChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain where the provider is
  connected

* `ProviderAddress ([]byte)`: The provider's blockchain address

* `ChangeSet (string)`: A structured definition of desired changes to an
  existing binding identified by the preceding three fields

![Figure of iService Definition and Bindings](https://github.com/irisnet/irisnet/blob/master/images/chap2-2.png?raw=true)

A provider can update `ServicePricing`, `ServiceLevel` and `BindingExpiration`
at any time, but a small amount of their deposit will be slashed for
changing the latter two (specified by `ServiceLevelUpdateSlash` and
`BindingExpirationUpdateSlash` respectively). Setting `BindingExpiration` to
a height that is lower than the current height will be interpreted as
invalidating the binding immediately.

Updates to `ProviderDeposit` will always be treated as *adding to* the
current deposit balance. Whenever the balance drops below
`MinProviderDeposit`, the binding will be disabled until the provider
increases the balance above the threshold. Upon expiration or
invalidation of a binding, the provider will automatically get back the
remaining balance of its deposit.

`BindingType` can be changed from `Local` to `Global`, but not the other way
around. To downgrade a binding from `Global` to `Local`, a provider must
first invalidate the binding in question and then create a new `Local`
binding.

If a provider somehow needs to move the binding to a new address, it is
not allowed to update `ProviderAddress` directly; instead, the provider
should invalidate the current binding and create another one with the
desired new `ProviderAddress`.

Upon successful execution of these two transactions by the application
(i.e., iService business logic in the IRIS SDK), a `ServiceBinding` object
will be created or updated accordingly.

A `ServiceBinding` is composed of:

* `DefinitionHash ([]byte)`

* `ChainID (string)`

* `ProviderAddress ([]byte)`

* `ServiceLevel (string)`

* `ServicePricing (string)`

* `BindingExpiration (int64)`

* `IsValid (enum)`: Can be one of `True` or `False`

**Service Invocation**

![Figure of Service Invocation](https://github.com/irisnet/irisnet/blob/master/images/chap2-3.png?raw=true)

Consumers and providers are proposed to interact with each other through *endpoints*.
There are two kinds of endpoints -- *request table* and *response table*
(see Figure above). Service requests are posted to request tables monitored
by interested provider(s) which pick up and process requests addressed
to them; service results (or errors) are posted back to response tables
monitored in turn by matched consumers.

For a `Multicast` service, all of its bindings share one request table;
for a `Unicast` service, however, a separate request table is created and
maintained for each of its bindings. As for the other direction, a dedicated response table would be created and managed for each consumer.

A `ServiceRequest` is composed of:

* `ChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain where the consumer is
  connected

* `ConsumerAddress ([]byte)`: The blockchain address of the consumer

* `DefinitionHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the service definition

* `MethodID (int)`: The ID of the method to be invoked

* `InputValue (string)`: A structured representation of input values

* `BindingHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the target binding, in case of a
  `Unicast` service. *Optional*

* `MaxServiceFee (int64)`: The max amount of service fee the consumer is
  willing to pay for a `Multicast` request. *Optional*

* `Timeout (int)`: The max number of blocks the consumer is willing to wait
  for response(s) to come back

A `PostServiceRequestTx` transaction is composed of:

* `Requests ([]ServiceRequest)`: The service requests to be posted

* `RequestDeposits ([]int64)`: The consumer must put down for each request
  a deposit (in terms of IRIS amount) that is greater than the value of
  `MinRequestDeposit`; this deposit is meant to incentivize the consumer to acknowledge receipt of service responses in a timely manner (see `ConfirmServiceResponseTx`).

The application will verify that each request is coming from a consumer
with matching `ChainID` and `ConsumerAddress`, the targeted binding is
valid, the request deposit is sufficient, the consumer's account balance is
enough to cover the request deposits and service fees, and that the total
number of requests in the transaction is less than `MaxRequestPostBatch`.

When a verified request is appended to the request table, the related
service fee (`MaxServiceFee` in case of a `Multicast` request) will be
deducted from the consumer's account and locked up in escrow.

A `GetServiceRequest` query is composed of:

* `DefinitionHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the service definition

* `BindingHash ([]byte)`: The hash of this provider's binding to the
  service in question; the application will verify that the binding is
  valid and the caller matches the binding's `ChainID` and `ProviderAddress`

* `BeginHeight (uint64)`: The blockchain height from where the application
  should start to retrieve requests for the provider, up to a total number
  that is the lesser of `BatchSize` and `MaxRequestGetBatch`

* `BatchSize (int)`: The max number of requests to be returned

A `ServiceResponse` is composed of:

* `RequestHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the matched request

* `BindingHash ([]byte)`: The hash of this provider's service binding

* `OutputValue ([]byte)`: A structured (potentially encrypted)
  representation of output result. *Optional*

* `ErrorMsg (string)`: A structured representation of error messages.
  *Optional*

A `PostServiceResponseTx` transaction is composed of:

* `Responses ([]ServiceResponse)`: The service responses to be posted

The application will verify that each response is coming from a
provider with matching `ChainID` and `ProviderAddress`, and that the number
of responses in the transaction is less than `MaxResponsePostBatch`. A
verified request will be appended to the response table for the intended
consumer.

A `GetServiceResponse` query is composed of:

* `RequestHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the original request; the
  application will verify that the caller matches the request's `ChainID`
  and `ConsumerAddress`

* `BeginHeight (uint64)`: The blockchain height from where the application
  should start to retrieve responses for the consumer, up to a total
  number that is the lesser of `BatchSize` and `MaxResponseGetBatch`

* `BatchSize (int)`: The max number of responses to be returned

A `ConfirmServiceResponseTx` transaction is composed of:

* `ResponseHash ([][]byte)`: The hash of responses to be confirmed

The application will verify that the each response to be confirmed is
indeed for a request originated by the caller, and that the number of
responses in the transaction is less than `MaxResponseConfirmBatch`.

Responses that fall out of the `Timeout` window (and, in case of `Multicast`
responses, when `MaxServiceFee` runs out as more responses come back) will
not be accepted by the application. A consumer starts processing a
`Unicast` response immediately upon receiving it. However, for `Multicast`
responses, a consumer will need to wait until the `Timeout` window elapses before
starting to process all responses received, if any.

When a `Unicast` response is confirmed by the consumer, the associated
service fee will be released from escrow to the matched provider account
-- after a small tax (defined by `ServiceFeeTaxRate`) is deducted and
added to the *system reserve*; and the associated request deposit will
be returned to the consumer as well.

In the case of a `Multicast` request, the situation is a bit more complex:
when a response is confirmed, only part of the request deposit is
returned to the consumer, in proportion to the response related service
fee vs `MaxServiceFee`; and after all responses are confirmed, the
remaining escrow balance for the request will be returned to the
consumer.

If a request timeouts without seeing any response come back, the
application will refund the associated balance held in escrow plus the request
deposit, in full, back to the consumer. However, if the consumer does
not confirm a response in time (before `ResponseConfirmTimeout` +
blockchain height of the response), a small penalty (defined by
`ResponseConfirmDelayPenaltyRate`) will be applied before the request
deposit is refunded to the consumer, while the associated service fee
will be released to the provider as usual.

**Dispute Resolution**

In any case where a consumer is unsatisfied with a service response, a mechanism should exist allowing the consumer to issue a complaint and consequently, to receive an acceptable solution to that complaint, without having to resort to a centralized authority such as the legal system.  Also, this mechanism should avoid
introducing subjective evaluation, which could be abused by either side.

The process to resolve a dispute that arises on the IRIS network resembles that of service invocation, except that a consumer sends a `Complaint` to the provider, and the provider responds with a `Resolution`.  These interactions are intended to happen through a pair of global endpoints known as *complaint table* and *resolution table*.

Under the present design for the IRIS network, a consumer deposit is required for filing a complaint.  Where a consumer does not confirm a resolution in a timely manner, a penalty will be deducted from this deposit.  Similarly, a provider's deposit will be partially slashed if he fails to respond to a complaint in a timely manner.

A `Complaint` is composed of:

* `ResponseHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the response in dispute

* `Problem (string)`: A description of the problem with the service response

* `PreferredDisposal (enum)`: Can be one of `Refund` or `Redo`

A Resolution is composed of:

* `ComplaintHash ([]byte)`: The hash of the matched complaint

* `Disposal (enum)`: Can be one of `Refund` or `Redo`

* `Refund (uint64)`: Service fee refund. *Optional*

* `OutputValue ([]byte)`: A structured (potentially encrypted)
  representation of output result. *Optional*

Our intended dispute resolution process, as outlined above, may not be legally binding.  Nonetheless, we believe that it will provide an efficient means of resolving common disputes on the IRIS network.

**Service Profiling**

Bootstrapping the iService ecosystem presents a few challenges.  A major challenge is finding a way to make it easy for consumers to discover suitable providers - consumers need performance metrics to evaluate and select a provider, yet without consumer usage no performance metrics will be available.

With the intention to solve this circular issue, we plan to introduce a profiling mechanism where a privileged system user, the profiler, invokes all the active services on a regular schedule.  This would leave objective performance data in the network (such as response time, availability, complaint handling etc.) that are useful for real consumers.

Service profiling calls would be exempt from service fees and consumer
deposits, but they would incur network transaction fees. These calls
would originate from a few reserved addresses that are intended to be recognized and honored by the application.

Profiling activities would stay at a relatively stable level for new services
and gradually decline for individual services as they start to
attract real consumer calls, which is expected to generate more performance data on their own.

Transaction fees incurred during profiling would be paid out from the system reserve by default, and the Foundation reserve would step in if necessary.

**Query**

All the service related lifecycle objects described above can be queried
using the ABCI Query interface [\[3\]][3]. These queries would be executed over
the Query connection and do not participate in the consensus process. We
have already seen how `GetServiceRequest` and `GetServiceResponse` queries
work as part of the service invocation process.

Below is a non-exhaustive summary of our currently planned queries:

**Service Objects**

| Object                               | Commonly Used Filters                | Authorization                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Service Definition                       | Name, keywords, source (chain ID), messaging type, with active bindings... | Anyone can query                         |
| Service Binding (for a given definition) | Location (local or remote), pricing, service level, expiration... | Anyone can query                         |
| Service Request                          | Service definition and binding, blockchain height, batch size | Only matched provider(s) |

### IBC Enhancement

One unique advantage of establishing our service infrastructure on top of Cosmos is the potential for services to be *deployed once and invoked
everywhere*, over an internet of blockchains. Specifically, our plan is to
accomplish the following:

1. Service definitions are broadcast to every zone in the IRIS network;

2. Global service bindings are broadcast to every zone in the IRIS network;

3. Service requests or complaints targeting a remote provider are routed to
  the blockchain to which the provider is connected;

4. Service responses or resolution meant for a remote consumer are routed
  back to the blockchain to which the consumer is connected.

When processing a `CreateServiceDefinitionTx` transaction, the application
is designed to first validate and store the `ServiceDefinition` object locally, before creating an `IBCPacket` containing the definition for each neighboring chain.

Each neighbor eventually receives -- from the corresponding relay process --
an `IBCPacketTx` containing the packet; if the definition does not already
exist in the receiving chain, the latter will pass on the definition by
creating an `IBCPacket` for each of *its* neighbors -- except the source
chain from which it received the packet in the first place; if the
definition already exists, the receiving chain stops passing on the
definition.

Similarly, when a `ServiceBinding` is created or updated with its
`BindingType` set or updated to `Global`, an `IBCPacket` containing the
binding is created for each neighboring chain, and gets propagated across
the entire IRIS network.

An `IBCPacket` described above is composed of:

* `Header (IBCPacketHeader)`: The packet header

* `Payload (ServiceDefinition or ServiceBinding)`: The bytes of the service
  definition or binding

The `IBCPacketHeader` above is composed of:

* `SrcChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain creating this packet

* `DstChainID (string)`: The ID of the neighboring blockchain this packet is
  destined for

* `Number (int)`: A unique number for all packets

* `Status (enum)`: `NoAck`

* `Type (string)`: "iris-service-definition" or "iris-service-binding"

Now let's take a look at how interchain service invocation happens through IBC.
When a request is made for a `Unicast` service, the application checks if
the target binding is `Local`; where this is true, the `ServiceRequest` is appended to the corresponding request table as explained in 2.2; otherwise, an
`IBCPacket` containing the `ServiceRequest` will be created instead.

An `IBCPacket` containing a `ServiceRequest` is composed of:

* `Header (IBCPacketHeader)`: The packet header

* `Payload (ServiceRequest)`: The bytes of the service request

The `IBCPacketHeader` above is composed of:

* `SrcChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain creating this packet

* `DstChainID (string)`: The ID of the blockchain where the remote provider
  is located, i.e., `ServiceRequest.ServiceBinding.ChainID`

* `Number (int)`: A unique number for all packets

* `Status (enum)`: `AckPending`

* `Type (string)`: "iris-service-request"

* `MaxHeight (int)`: Current height + `ServiceRequest.Timeout`

As a remote request finally arrives at the destination chain, the
application would append it to the corresponding endpoint (the request table)
for the targeted binding. A response to this remote request would be
wrapped in a receipt `IBCPacket` that is routed all the way back to the
source chain and appended to the remote endpoint (the response table) for
the originating consumer.

Request for a remote `Multicast` service is treated in the same way except
that more than one `IBCPacket` could be generated in the source chain.

Remote complaints and resolutions are expected to work in the same manner as requests and responses, and therefore will not be elaborated here.

Below is a complete list of application-dependent `IBCPacket` types:

| **Type**                  | **iService Object** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| "iris-service-definition" | ServiceDefinition   |
| "iris-service-binding"    | ServiceBinding      |
| "iris-service-request"    | ServiceRequest      |
| "iris-service-response"   | ServiceResponse     |
| "iris-complaint"          | Complaint           |
| "iris-resolution"         | Resolution          |

## Use Cases ################################################################

In this section, we have set out some potential use cases for the IRIS network.

### Distributed AI for privacy preserving data analysis

The proposed service infrastructure has been prototyped by Bianjie AI, a
Shanghai based startup, into its permission product `BEAN (Blockchain
Edge Analytics Network)` to solve the longstanding challenge of getting
data for running analytics models. Although homomorphic encryption is
one of the key methods allowing computing to be achieved over encrypted data, it is said to be unable to practically solve real world machine learning problems due to its slow performance. As a result, BEAN was created to take a different approach. This approach uses the idea of model parallelism taken from the traditional distributed AI study [\[14\]][14] and
utilizing SOA design patterns to develop distributed analytics services as an additional layer to the blockchain.

To protect data access, the (partial) model that runs on the data side needs to be open sourced to the client and specified in the service definition. Since only the partial model is released to the client, the model developers do not have to worry about someone stealing their idea; equally, the data owners never need to worry about losing control of data usage as their data will not be leaving its origin.

Other potential benefits could include the following:
1.	Only a small amount of parametric data being exchanged on-chain, which can help enhance performance.

2.	A more practical way for data usage auditing, which is often needed in the healthcare domain.

Healthcare data is highly private, involving numerous security requirements. This puts forward the challenge for healthcare data to be used for the purposes of cross-organization collaboration (such as a cross-hospital clinic records search for diagnosis assistance, new drug clinic test patient identification, health insurance automatic claim processing etc.). This minimum viable product ("MVP") service layer implementation is built on top of `Ethermint` in attempt to connect hospitals, insurance companies and analytics service providers to provide privacy preserving healthcare data analytics capability.

Smart contracts have been implemented to support on-chain service registration and invocation. One example of the off-chain data processing could be to support a Diagnosis Related Group ("DRG") grouping analytics service. More specifically, when a hospital user invokes the DRG service, the raw medical record is processed off-chain using service provider provided client side NLP (implemented as SQL and Python) code stub to exact structured data inputs for receiving DRGs service over blockchain without passing the highly confidential raw medical records.

The `BEAN`
scenario demonstrates a more complicated service use case including
implementing distributed analytics, and connecting service providers as
well as service consumers, utilizing blockchain to provide audible
transaction ledge as well as trustworthy distributed computing
foundation.

### Data and analytics e-marketplace

From studying several proposed AI+Blockchain projects, it seems that most of the projects aim to provide data exchange markets and analytics API markets. With proposed `IRIS` infrastructure, those
networks could potentially be built with ease through publishing data as data services and wrapping analytics API as analytics services utilizing the `IRIS` service provider SDK.

### Distributed e-commerce

With the proposed `IRIS` infrastructure, integration with traditional systems
like `ERP` to obtain inventory information, or inter-chain query on trusted data sources to obtain information such as transportation and weather data, will be quite similar to the approach with which many enterprise application developers are already familiar. With those services integrated to support
distributed e-commerce applications, it could be possible for distributed e-commerce applications to provide a similar user experience as centralized systems, such as Amazon or Alibaba.

### Combining public chains & consortium chains

For many business scenarios, taking a hybrid architecture of combining the good features of a public chain and a consortium chain can provide beneficial results, particularly with regards to performance, security and economic incentives.

For example, hospitals and insurance companies could form a consortium blockchain to support high performance medical insurance transactions, whilst identifying other information such as statistics regarding certain diseases as a global service, which can be invoked from other public chains. The tokens received from public chains can be awarded back to
those information providers in the consortium chain, which motivate the
system participants to improve and promote services. With this infrastructure provided by `IRIS`, large-scale spontaneous collaboration could be made possible while still supporting stringent performance and security requirements.

There are many use cases that could be supported by the `IRIS` service
infrastructure, such as more efficient asset based security systems,
distributed regulation technology such as due diligence, mutual aid
marketplace etc. One of `IRIS` project plans is also working closely with
such application project teams to support and enable them with needed
blockchain infrastructure and allow them to focus on delivering the
envisioned business value more efficiently.

## Token Economics ################################################################

Similar to the Cosmos Network, the IRIS network, as presently designed, is intended to support a multi-token model. The tokens will be held on the various zones, and can be moved from one zone to another via the IRIS Hub. There are two types of tokens that are expected to support IRIS network's operation:

* staking token
* fee token

### Staking token

Adopting the same staking mechanism design used in the Cosmos network [\[15\]][15], the IRIS Hub will have its own special native token for staking. This token will be called "IRIS". We have a number of ideas in mind regarding the specific functionality of the IRIS token, including:

* integration of the IRIS token in the IRIS network's consensus engine validators, through a system of validators and delegators;

* voting power to participate in the IRIS network's governance


### Fee token

There are two types of fee tokens in IRIS network:
* **Network fee** token is for spam-prevention and payment to validators in maintaining the
  ledger;
* **Service fee** token is used for payment to service providers
  who deploy iServices and the default payment service token is IRIS token.

The IRIS network is intended to support all whitelisted fee tokens from the Cosmos network, e.g [Photon](https://blog.cosmos.network/cosmos-fee-token-introducing-the-photon-8a62b2f51aa), plus the IRIS token.

Supporting a variety of whitelisted fee tokens is a feature that we plan to adopt from Cosmos. It can provide an enhanced experience for network participants. In Cosmos, for `network fee token`, each validator has a config
file defines his personal weighting of how much they value each fee
token. Validator can run a separate cron job to update the config file
based on validator preferred live market data or maybe just use a
default config value.

For the `service fee token` design, similarly a multi-token model is planned to be supported.  A service provider on the IRIS network should therefore have the freedom to charge for their services in their preferred tokens, provided that it appears on the whitelist.

To help IRIS network participants mitigate cryptocurrency price volatility, the Foundation intends to facilitate the deployment of global iServices for retrieving market data from different exchanges, or through the potential introduction of oracles.

Both staking and fee tokens are subject to further refinement to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory obligations.

<div STYLE="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Initial Token Distribution ################################################################

On Genesis, the initial token supply will be 2,000,000,000 IRIS tokens.  The distribution of IRIS tokens is planned to be as follows:

* **Private Sale**: 20%

* **Core Developer Team**: 20% (4-year vesting period starting from IRIS Hub launch, during which the team will vest 1/48th of its IRIS tokens each month)

* **IRIS Foundation**: 15% (reserved to support the operations of the Foundation)

* **Ecosystem Development**: 45% (swap with zones connecting to IRIS Hub; grant to potential users; awards to outstanding partners; potential public sale)

If and when the IRIS network is fully deployed, the annual inflation rate of IRIS tokens will be adjusted to account for the fact that a substantial portion of IRIS tokens in circulation may be voluntarily staked by participants to participate in the consensus engine.

Proceeds from the private sale of IRIS tokens will be used, first and foremost, for the development of the IRIS network. The planned usage distribution is as follows:

* **Foundation Operations**: 10% (including service providers and contractors fees, for example, auditing, consulting, legal and other third party fees, and other overheads)

* **Software Development**: 50% (including costs, fees and expenses directly attributable to the development of launch)

* **Developer Enablement**: 10% (including funding hackathons, awards to volunteers and training programs)

* **Research and Development Sponsorships**: 10% (including conference, research programs and university outreach)

* **Marketing and Promotion**: 20% (including business development, community programs and outreach, together with related travel, communication, publication, distribution and other expenses)


<div STYLE="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Roadmap ################################################################

The expected IRIS project is set out below. We reiterate that the roadmap is indicative only, and subject to change.

* **PANGU** (January 2018 \~ June 2018) The first stage of the IRIS project will focus on having the IRIS Hub up and running and connected to the Cosmos Hub. We also intend to release an initial version of the mobile client for the IRIS network.


* **NUWA** (July 2018 \~ November 2018)
The second stage will focus on building the fundamental IRIS Service Layer. This will involve enabling service definition, binding, invocation and query.
In this stage we are also aiming to have a beta version of the IRIS SDK ready for developers.

* **KUAFU** (December 2018 \~ May 2019) The third stage will focus on incremental upgrades to the IRIS network in order to support our planned advanced IRIS Service governance features.


* **HOUYI** (Beyond June 2019)
The fourth stage will focus on further technology innovations to the IRIS network, IRIS SDK and mobile client, as well as developer engagement.
